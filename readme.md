# Crystal Collector

* The purpose of this game is not to entertain you. It will quickly fail at this. The game was created as a web development bootcamp assignment. So no, I don't have a weird crystal obsession.

## Instructions

* You will be given a random 'Target Score' at the beginning of each game.

* You can click on each of the 4 crystals to add a specified (but hidden) amount of points to your score.

* Your goal is to match the Target Score exactly.

* Exceeding the Target Score will result in a loss.

* Each crystal value changes at the start of a new game.
